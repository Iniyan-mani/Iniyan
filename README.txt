| Tresata ACADEMY Hard-skills Exercises                                      |
==============================================================================

Welcome the Tresata academy exercises! We recommend you take a look at and
implement these in tandem with or immediately after the courses in Tresata
Academy.

All of these exercises (aside from spark-txns) you should be able to complete
locally, assuming bash, the scala compiler, and SBT (the scala build tool) are
installed on your machine.

Instructions for each section are included in the READMEs, so be sure to
thoroughly and completely review each when acclimating yourself to the problem
set.
